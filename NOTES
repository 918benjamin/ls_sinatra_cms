Current:
- Set up file structure (root directory, /public, /views)
- set up Gemfile (bundle init) - source, ruby version, gems & versions
  - bundle install
- set up app.rb
  - require gems
  - 
- set up route for get "/"



Done:




Future:
Look at automating the project setup process - rake? bash?
What is tilt? What is erubis? Why don't we need to require "erb"?
