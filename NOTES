Current:
- Create the required initial documents in /public
- 



Done:
- Set up file structure (root directory, /public, /views)
- set up Gemfile (bundle init) - source, ruby version, gems & versions
  - bundle install
- set up app.rb
  - require gems
- set up route for get "/" in app.rb


Reminders:
- erb files go in the /views
- erb files need to be referenced in a route
- When you start using erb files, require "tilt/erubis" in main app file and add gem "erubis" to Gemfile
- Every time you change the gemfile, run bundle install
- Run program with bundle exec prepend


Future:
Look at automating the project setup process - rake? bash?
What is tilt? What is erubis? Why don't we need to require "erb"?
